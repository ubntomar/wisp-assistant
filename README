The goal of this project is to develop a portable tool running on a Flask server that will assist field technicians with limited technical experience in quickly configuring CPE equipment and routers with a simple and intuitive interface.

The hardware to be used for deploying the application that will run the server is an Orange Pi 5 with 1 GB of RAM and running Ubuntu Server 22.04.
